    <h2>Kyle T in the Future!</h2>
    <p>The picture to the right is of the Argonne National Laboratory in Dupage County, Illinois. This is one of the places I think would be really cool to work at in the future. The lab is a federally funded center for research and development operated by the University of Chicago.</p>

    <p>I currently have 1 more semester until I graduate in Spring of 2026. Upon graduation, I will be moving out of state to Illinois where my girlfriend currently lives. We will be moving in together and I will need to find a job there. There is a lot that goes into moving out of state and away from your family but I'm very excited to get started. In the not so distant future, I'm hoping me and my girlfriend can get engaged soon (always nerve racking). In the future I would love to keep traveling to places I've never been before as well as enjoying nature as much as I can. I would also love to get a dog in the future, I've only ever owned cats so it would be quite the change for me!</p>
