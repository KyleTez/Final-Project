        <p class="paragraph">Although I didn't have an exact picture, the photo to the right is a accurate example of the types of forts I would make. Using fallen trees and sticks, a ton of mud, and some loose leafs or vines I could make a relatively stable structure within a day! Sometimes getting so intricate there would be separate rooms.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Growing up, I was always a very shy kid. I loved going outside and being in nature. Some of my favorite things to do was to ride my bike through the local nature trails that surrounded my neighborhood, build awesome forts in the woods by using fallen trees and mud, and hanging out with my friends whenever I could. I was also a huge gamer growing up, I loved sitting in the recliner and playing video game on my PlayStation 4 that I got for Christmas. I would usually play games like Minecraft, Overwatch, or Call of Duty. As I grew up I slowly moved away from playing video games on console and started to play on computers! I built my first desktop computer when I was about 12 years old and it was the most fun I've ever had.</p>
