    <h2>Kyle T in the Present!</h2>
    <p>The picture to the right is one that I took on a recent trip that I went on with my girlfriend to Mackinac Island. The picture is taken through the hole of Arch Rock looking down to the water of Lake Huron. We had beautiful weather the whole trip and had an amazing time!</p>
    <p>I currently attend Michigan State University. My major is in Information Science with a focus in Media and Information. I also work at the Michigan Department of Attorney General as an IT student. I still love to play video games but I've switched to a lot newer games such as Marvel Rivals, I've also slowly picked up games such as League of Legends and DOTA! I also have really loved traveling taking trips to Flroida, Mackinac Island, the UP, Missouri, and even Europe! I still love to ride my bike, MSU's campus has so many amazing trails and paths you can take, it's nice to get a breath of fresh air to break up the stress of classes.</p>
