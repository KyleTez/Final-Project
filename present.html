        <p class="paragraph">I currently attend Michigan State University. My major is in Information Science with a focus in Media and Information. I also work at the Michigan Department of Attorney General as an IT student. I still love to play video games but I've switched to a lot newer games such as Marvel Rivals, I've also slowly picked up games such as League of Legends and DOTA! I also have really loved traveling taking trips to Florida, Mackinac Island, the UP, Missouri, and even Europe! I still love to ride my bike, MSU's campus has so many amazing trails and paths you can take, it's nice to get a breath of fresh air to break up the stress of classes.</p>
